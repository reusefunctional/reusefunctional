# Running the system
The only build dependency is __The Haskell Platform__, which will also install the _stack_ build system.

When in the project directory, running the command `stack run input-file` will synthesize a program based on the input file (relative path). For example, running `stack run test/droplasts.test` will produce the solution for the drop lasts problem.
